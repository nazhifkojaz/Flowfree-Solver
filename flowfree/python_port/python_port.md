# `python_port` (python port for the C# implementation)

Python port of the original C# implementation, a simple head-extending FC + DFS solver. FC is used to prune/maintain domains and bookkeep for backtracking, and DFS explores the search space/tree based on MRV + distance ordering.

## How it works

- **State & Board**: Cells hold a single color value or `-1` for empty/unassigned cells.
- **Headâ€‘extending search** (`csp_solver.py`): pick an *active* head bas
- **Forward Checking** (`csp_fc.py`): on each tentative move, filter neighbor domains; abort early if a domain becomes empty.
- **Backtracking**: if a move fails later, undo the FC log and try the next neighbor.
- **Variable ordering**: MRV (minimum remaining values) + manhattan distance tiebreaker (prefer candidates closer to target).

## Notes

- This solver is pretty basic and straightforward, with little to no optimization, the results are not very impressive.
- The number of attempts and backtracks are generally increasing with puzzle size due to the growth of search space.
- Showed both mean and median to illustrate the skewness of the data (the unsolved/timed_out puzzles can significantly skew the mean so the median is often more representative).
